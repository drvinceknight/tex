In the editor type the following:

```language-latex
{% include main.tex %}
```

The next step is to *compile* this `tex` file.  For the purposes of this
tutorial I recommend compiling with a modern compiler like `pdflatex` or
`xelatex`. **If you are using a cloud based service compilation usually happens
automatically.**
