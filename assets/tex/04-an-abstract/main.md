### An abstract

The following will add an abstract to your document:

```language-latex
\begin{abstract}
    This document contains some basic LaTeX code that will be useful to me
    in the future.
\end{abstract}
```

Your full document will now look like:

```language-latex
{% include main.tex %}
```
