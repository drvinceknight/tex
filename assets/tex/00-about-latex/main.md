is then 'translated' to a form that is 'human readable'.

A powerful typesetting language that is popular in scientific writing is
\\(\LaTeX\\) (pronounced: lay-tech).

This resource gives an overview of \\(\LaTeX\\): you can either install
\\(\LaTeX\\) on your own computer:

- [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/) on windows
- [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) on OS X


If you do not already have an installed version I recommend
[overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/) a cloud based service.
